# Welcome to the Level Tutorial Assignment!

In this assignment, I have added 3 interesting mechanics: Wind, Jump-Pads, and now 
a gun!

Jump with space

To shoot your gun, left-click on the mouse and aim with the pointer. The bullet will shoot forward in the way the player is facing!

Jump over pitfalls, shoot crabs, and fly through the wind to reach victory through these desert wind temples!
